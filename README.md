# Effect of Crime on the Housing Market in the Houston Metro-Area

## Introduction:
The largest and most important purchase that a consumer will make in his lifetime is a house. A lot of time and energy goes into determining exactly what one wants in a new home. The buyer must figure out their preferences regarding the location of the house, including the city,  neighborhood, and proximity to certain amenities and general aesthetic style while a significant amount of attention is drawn into crime, school and life quality. Theoretically, homebuyers would pay a premium in order to live in a physically safe environment to avoid crime, as well as the mental security of knowing that they are safe.  In this report we will take a closer look into the methodology and results of analyzing Houston and a selection of surrounding citiesâ€™ crime data and housing market. The analysis in this report focuses on the years between 2012-2018 and examines the following:

* What is the average crime rate across the top 10 largest cities in the Houston metropolitan area?
* What is the average and median sales price across the top 10 largest cities in the Houston metropolitan area?
* Do houses stay on the market longer in higher crime areas?
* Is there a correlation between average or median sales price and the average or median crime rate crime?
* Do violent crimes or non-violent crimes have a bigger impact on home sales?
* What is the effect of city demographics on median price and crime rates?

## Methodology


## Results
### What is the average crime rate across the top 10 largest cities in the Houston metropolitan area?

The initial analysis examined the crime per capita for each city from 2012 to 2018.  The data indicates that most cities in scope have lower crime rates in 2018 as compared to 2012.  The city with the highest crime rate over the last seven years is Houston followed by Galveston and Baytown.  The safest city over the last seven years is Friendswood, followed by Missouri City and Sugar Land.

Calculating the mean crime rate per capita over the last seven years, Houston has the highest amount of crime in the metropolitan area and nearly six times as much crime as the city with the lowest amount of crime, Friendswood.  Houston also has the highest amount of violent and property crimes in the metropolitan area.  Galveston and Baytown are ranked second and third respectively for the highest amount of crime in the metropolitan area.  For each city in scope, the property crimes far outweigh the number of violent crimes.  The safest city in the metropolitan area is Friendswood followed by Missouri City and Sugar Land.
