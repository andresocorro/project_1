# Effect of Crime on the Housing Market in the Houston Metro-Area

### Introduction:
The largest and most important purchase that a consumer will make in his lifetime is a house. A lot of time and energy goes into determining exactly what one wants in a new home. The buyer must figure out their preferences regarding the location of the house, including the city,  neighborhood, and proximity to certain amenities and general aesthetic style while a significant amount of attention is drawn into crime, school and life quality. Theoretically, homebuyers would pay a premium in order to live in a physically safe environment to avoid crime, as well as the mental security of knowing that they are safe.  In this report we will take a closer look into the methodology and results of analyzing Houston and a selection of surrounding citiesâ€™ crime data and housing market. The analysis focus on the years between 2012-2018.  The analysis in this report will examine:

* What is the average crime rate across the top 10 largest cities in the Houston metropolitan area?
* What is the average and median sales price across the top 10 largest cities in the Houston metropolitan area?
* Do houses stay on the market longer in higher crime areas?
* Is there a correlation between average or median sales price and the average or median crime rate crime?
* Do violent crimes or non-violent crimes have a bigger impact on home sales?
* What is the effect of city demographics on median price and crime rates?
